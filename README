A brief description of the code:

  cmds/permissioncontroller
      A replacement for the Java PermissionController
      service.  This is the service that decides who can
      connect to which binder interfaces.  This stub
      allows anyone to connect.

  cmds/powermanager
      A stub replacement for the PowerManager.java
      service.  This is used by StageFright to prevent
      the system from going to sleep while playing media
      files.  This stub doesn't do anything other than
      allow clients to connect.
